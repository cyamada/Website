#Welcome to my source code!
Hopefully you can learn a thing or two (or even give me some pointers) from my code.  
Everything you see here is what is currently behind the whole site (excluding WordPress).  
You can find out even more information on how I went about building it by checking out  
some [blog posts](http://www.cyamada.com/blog/category/website-redesign/) I did.

If you have any questions send me an email at <ckyamada@gmail.com></code>
